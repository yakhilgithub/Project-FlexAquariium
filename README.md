# Project-FlexAquariium
## Day21 of 30 days 30 projects challenge

Hey there, underwater explorers! Welcome to FlexAquariium, a project close to my heart where I've unleashed the power of Flexbox to create a gallery of mesmerizing aquatic life. 🌊


## Code Deconstructed 🛠️
Wondering what's cooking in the FlexAquariium's code? Let me break it down for you in simple terms!

(FB.html) :
So, in the `FB.html` file, you'll find the basic setup for our webpage. Those `<div>` buddies inside the `.container`? Yup, those are our underwater cards. Each card is like a peek into the aquatic universe.

(FB.css) :
This is where the style magic happens! The styles in `FB.css` make our cards look neat. We're talking about spacing, borders, and even some fancy effects like shadows and zooming in when you hover over a card.

No Extra Tricks Just so you know, I've kept it simple. No fancy libraries or complicated stuff—just plain HTML and CSS. Easy-peasy, right?
